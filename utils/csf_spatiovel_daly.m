% rho - spatial frequency in cycles per degree [cpd]
% vel - retinal velocity in deg / sec

% The original model is undefined for vel=0. The rationale could be that
% the sensitivity is 0 for a stationary image on the retina (the image
% disappers without any eye movements). To prevent NaNs, the model has
% been modified so that the minimum velocity is min_vel=0.1 [deg/sec]. 
% 0.1 [deg/sec] approximately corresponds to the minimum velocity of
% the eye during a fixation.
